The concept seems reasonable enough. And hopefully this shouldnt be too difficult.

I Liked this project for the fact that it allowed me to use a bloc, this is
good practice. The main problem I had was the ability to actually swap two
elements in an array. Researching online resulted in the following way:
array[i], array[i+1] = array[i+1], array[i]
This 'parallel assignment' (i think it's called) is new to me!
This project was great in that I used a bloc for legitimate reasons. But more
importantly, I learnt something new.
